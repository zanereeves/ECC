## Timeline
### This week
I completed an secp implementation that is reasonably effective. I have obtained a
more rote understanding of Elliptic Curves and I did some research on Pedersen commitments.
I am currently bouncing between either implementing BN254 curves because it sounds like fun
or continuing on the Pedersen commitment path.

Materials used: An Introduction to Mathematical Cryptography by J. Hoffstein and et al.
Elliptic Curves, Number Theory, and Cryptography by K. H. Rosen.
Abstract Algebra, Theory and Applications by Thomas W. Judson.

Pedersen commitments use two generators over a finite field group (which we will call M and N)
where the discrete logarithm problem is considered computationally infeasible and generates a
proof of commitment to a value that is computationally cheap to prove and hiding so that an
outside observer would have difficulty discovering a value r known as the blinding factor such
that they could independently discover the committed value. Since we need to use generators
over a finite field group weâ€™ll use elliptic curve cryptography to provide our needed generators M
and N.

## Next week
Work on implementing Pedersen commitments and read up on the theory.

A popular choice of curve for Pedersen Commitments is curve25519, I need to look into
exactly what makes this curve so desirable.

## Week after
Start working on Nova proof model.
